I am communicating because as in, Civil Action No. 1:23-cv-2659 FEDERAL TRADE
COMMISSION, and CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU, Plaintiffs, v.
TRANSUNION RENTAL SCREENING SOLUTIONS, INC., a Delaware corporation, and
TRANS UNION LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Defendants, I am also a victim
of said case.
<br /><br />
On numerous occasions I asked you to put a freeze on my credit report because I may
have been a victim of identity theft. I clearly made you aware of the situation before any
accounts were falsely opened and you lied and said that a credit freeze was active
pursuant to my call. You lied and never put a credit freeze as said leaving the report open
for possible identity theft. . Pursuant to § 621 of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. § 1681s, a violation
of the FCRA constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or practice in or affecting commerce,
in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(a).
<br /><br />
The FCRA imposes several obligations on Consumer Reporting Agencies, including
obligations to: (1) follow reasonable procedures to assure the maximum possible
accuracy of the information in Consumer Reports, 15 U.S.C. § 1681e(b), and (2) upon a
consumer’s request, disclose to the consumer all information contained in the
consumer’s file and the sources of the information, 15 U.S.C. § 1681g(a). 16. Pursuant to
§ 621 of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C. § 1681s, a violation of the FCRA constitutes an unfair or
deceptive act or practice in or affecting commerce, in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC
Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(a).

original creditor bearing my signature as validation that in fact those accounts are
legitimate. That documentation is to be sent to the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau (“CFPB”) as well as sent to me via certified mail, as per the Fair Credit Reporting
Act 15 U.S. Code 1681i. Procedure in case of disputed accuracy. Also 15 U.S. Code 1611.
Criminal liability for willful and knowing violation. I am keeping a careful record of your
actions, including Method of Verification, I DO NOT CONSENT to e-oscar or any means of
