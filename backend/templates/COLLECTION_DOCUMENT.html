Attention:
<br /><br />
I am sending this to you today because I have pulled my most recent credit report and I am
extremely confused. It is very troubling as these items are reported as collections.
<br /><br />
According to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), specifically 15 U.S.C. ยง 1692e
(previously mentioned as 807) which prohibits the use of false or misleading information, and 15
U.S.C. ยง 1692j (previously mentioned as 8012) which prohibits furnishing deceptive forms, the
agent in question is in non-compliance. Per 15 U.S.C. ยง 1692g, I should have been provided
written notification of this matter at least five days in advance, which I was not. As the sole
original creditor, I have the exclusive authority to validate this debt. I hereby state that I DO NOT
VALIDATE THIS DEBT.
<br /><br />
According to 15 U.S.C. 1681i, Paragraph (5), if a consumer disputes any information and it is
found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable, the consumer reporting agency must
promptly delete the item.
